    "How can we design a flexible thermogalvanic device that simultaneously maximizes both Carnot-relative efficiency and mechanical robustness for sustainable energy harvesting from body heat?",
    "\"Background Survey Summary\r\nPrior to the development of the flexible thermogalvanic device described in this paper, there were significant advances in thermoelectric and thermogalvanic technologies, particularly in the context of energy harvesting from body heat. Key technologies included:\r\nThermoelectric Devices: Traditional semiconductor thermoelectric generators (TEGs), while effective at converting heat to electricity, often faced limitations in efficiency, especially when dealing with low-grade heat sources like body heat. These devices typically suffered from low thermopower and were limited by rigid structures, which made them less suitable for wearable applications.\r\n2. Quasi-Solid Thermocells: The emergence of quasi-solid thermocells, which used gel networks to confine liquid electrolytes, provided a promising alternative. These devices offered higher flexibility and better integration into wearable electronics. However, they faced a significant trade-off between mechanical robustness and thermoelectric efficiency. Enhancing one often compromised the other, making it challenging to achieve both high mechanical strength and high thermoelectric performance in a single device.\r\n3. Materials and Molecular Engineering: The introduction of functional additives like guanidine hydrochloride (GdmCl) into thermocells improved the thermopower by increasing the entropy difference of redox couples. However, this improvement typically led to weakened mechanical properties due to the salting-in effect induced by the Hofmeister series, which negatively affected the polymer chains' interactions.\r\n4. Structural Design Innovations: Attempts to overcome these limitations included reinforcing polymer networks through double-network designs or creating anisotropic structures via methods like ice-templating. These approaches aimed to decouple the mechanical and thermoelectric properties, but they often resulted in compromises, such as lower output power densities or reduced efficiency due to slow ionic migration.\""
