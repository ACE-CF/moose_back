        "We propose that the design of a flexible thermogalvanic device can achieve an optimal balance between Carnot-relative efficiency and mechanical robustness by employing poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) grade KYNAR 721, which has a molecular weight of approximately 180,000 and high crystallinity, integrated with a gradient of hydrophobic pendant groups including octadecyl (C18) and trifluoroethyl (CF3) groups. This gradient will be generated through a two-step solvent casting process using dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent, with controlled casting at 60C, followed by drying at room temperature for 24 hours until a film thickness of 100 micrometers is achieved.\nSystematic synthesis of composite materials will be conducted by varying the weight ratios of C18 and CF3 pendant groups in conjunction with PVDF, examining ratios from 0:100 to 70:30 (C18:CF3). Characterization will include impedance spectroscopy measured in a frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz to evaluate ionic conductivity, alongside tensile tests performed at a strain rate of 10 mm/min to assess mechanical robustness.\nWe will systematically measure and control hydration levels via gravimetric analysis, and correlate these to ionic conductivity using defined benchmarks (e.g., ionic conductivity, , values of  0.1 S/m) and mechanical properties (e.g., tensile strength  3 MPa). By conducting this detailed investigation into how the gradient of hydrophobic groups affects both the electrochemical performance and mechanical properties, we aim to validate our hypothesis that this strategic design enhances the efficiency and durability of thermogalvanic energy harvesting devices derived from body heat. Further insights gained could inform the design of next-generation flexible energy harvesting technologies in wearable applications."
